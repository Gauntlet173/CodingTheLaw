# Syllabus
**Law 589 A05 - "Coding the Law", Fall 2020 
University of Alberta Faculty of Law  
Jason Morris, BA, LLB, LLM
9:00am-11:50am Fridays  
Room: Zoom**

## Course Objectives
Law is not immune to the technological changes that are occurring in the rest of society. As has happened in every other sector of the economy, globalization and technology will result in an increased automation of legal services. Indeed, because of the severity of the access to justice problem in Canada and other jurisdictions, the impetus to automate legal services is stronger than in many areas.

Not all lawyers need to become expert programmers, now or in the future. For those who choose to, there are certainly opportunities to make unique contributions. But this course is not designed to create expert programmers.

In the future lawyers will be called upon to advise their clients and their practices in developing, or certifying, or objecting to the outcomes of automated legal services. The encoding of legal instruments (laws, regulations, contracts) also provides opportunities for new types of automated legal analysis that have previously been impossible. Lawyers who are aware of the landscape of possibilities, and who have experience and gain confidence learning to use these new technologies, will be better equipped to protect and serve their clients and the public.

Confidence with learning and using technology is a transferable skill. It allows a lawyer to take advantage of more efficient practice models, supporting the lawyer’s opportunity to practice law independently. This can have beneficial effects for work-life balance for young lawyers by making solo practice a realistic possibility, and could as a result increase equity and improve health among the profession as a whole. The importance of the effective use of technology in legal practice has also been reinforced by recent events surround the Covid-19 pandemic.

**This course will *not* provide the law student with experience using the technologies they are most likely to be exposed to in practice. Instead, this course is designed to give law students an introduction to the types of *technologies being used for automating legal services* now and in the near future, their strengths, their weaknesses, and the trends in their development going into the future.**

The Course has three primary objectives:

* Give students practical experience automating legal services with current technology
* Give students a survey of and experience applying best practices in the automation of legal services
* Introduce students to an array of technologies for automating legal services

The course will provide students with an introduction to some of the best practices in automating legal services with regard to issues include:

* Regulatory compliance, and issues of professional liability for automated legal services.
* Ethical issues, such as algorithmic bias.
* Administrative law issues such as transparency and appealability
* Privacy issues and the use of and limits of encryption technologies.
* Professionalism issues such as informed consent as to the risks of automated services.

These topics will be surveyed with a focus on finding answers to the question "What, as a result of these concerns, should a person
who is automating legal services do differently?"

Technologies surveyed will include:

* rule-based artificial intelligence such as expert systems, and smart contracts
* data-based artificial intelligence such as machine learning
* automated client interview systems
* document automation tools
* online dispute resolution tools

Most exciting, the course will provide law students with the opportunity and skills to design and implement, in collaboration with a real or simulated client organization, an automated legal service using user-friendly, modern, free, open-source technology.

Docassemble is the tool used in the major projects. Docassemble is a leading open-source expert system and document automation tool. It has seen significant and increasing adoption in the pro bono sector, particularly in the United States.

Information on docassemble is available at https://docassemble.org.

## Course Structure

The course will consist of weekly three-hour seminars, and is divided into two phases.

In the first six weeks of the course, the focus is on acquiring the skills and experience with Docassemble required in order to successfully complete the major project. In this phase, classes will begin with an introduction to and instruction on the next set of Docassemble skills required, followed by time to complete the technical learning assignment for that week. Class participation marks in this phase of the course will be granted for sharing, either during class or between classes on the assigned Slack channel, error messages that the student received in the course of attempting to complete the technical learning assignment, and asking for assistance in resolving them.

The remainder of the course focuses on a survey of available technologies and issues surrounding the automation of legal services. During this phase of the course class participation will be granted for preparing for and participating in class discussions about relevant issues. Time will also be set aside to allow students to seek technical assisatnce with their major projects.

Throughout the semester speakers with experience automating legal services, or with the regulatory and professional issues surrounding the automation of legal services, will be invited to participate in question and answer sessions.

## Required Computing Resources

All mandatory course work will be done in Docassemble, which will be provided and accessible over the web. Students are therefore only required to bring with them to class a device with internet connectivity and a modern web browser.

Other tools will be surveyed that are available for educational use at no charge. Students who are interested in obtaining practical experience with those tools may find that hardware or operating restrictions apply to those pieces of software. Students will have the option of choosing a tool other than Docassemble for implementing the main project, with the prior approval of the instructor, in which case the student will need to provide hardware and software compatible with that product and the tools used for evaluation.

## Required Technology Experience

The course assumes a basic level of comfort with desktop computing software, and the use of the Internet through web browsers. **There is no expectation or requirement that a student will have prior programming experience.** It is intended that a student with no prior programming experience, but a willingness to experiment and learn, can excel in this course. It is also intended that a student with significant prior programming experience will have the opportunity to expand their understanding of and experience with those tools and others. Docassemble provides a different programming style than most experienced programmers will have experience with, and experience with it will expand your skill set as a software developer.

## Evaluation

Students will be evaluated on the following factors:

**In-Class Participation (10%)**: In the first phase of the course, students are expected to report errors, and seek help. This can happen during class, or between classes on the designated slack channel. In the second phase of the course, students are expected to  prepare for and participate in discussions about professional issues surrounding the automation of legal services. The assigned readings are intentionally minimal, and short, so students will be expected to be familiar with their contents.

**Technical Learning Assignments (20%)**: In the first phase of the course, students will be assigned small weekly projects to demonstrate their ability to use basic features of Docassemble. Students are expected to generate original code to satisfy the assignments, and to upload that code to a GitHub repository shared with the instructor as evidence of having completed it.

**Major Project (70%)**: Students will work in small groups (typically no larger than 5) to design and implement a simple automated legal service using one of the tools studied in the course. Student groups may be determined by the instructor if necessary in order to ensure that each group has students who are confident in their technical ability to implement the major project. It is intended that the scope and complexity of these projects will be realistic for any student who has completed the Technical Learning Assignments in the first phase of the course, with an investment of time and effort outside of classes equivalent to other 3-credit courses.

In addition to building the automated legal service, the students will be required to do a simulated “pitch” of that tool to an organizational user, directly addressing the concerns that user is likely to have about the tools benefits and risks.

The project will consist of three parts, which will be evaluated according to the following rubric:

1. Project Design Specifications (20% of project mark)

    The students will be asked to generate a project design specifications document in collaboration with their client organization. This document will be assessed for its professionalism, the degree to which it reflects the needs of the client, the degree to which it considers and addresses relevant professionalism cocnerns, and the degree to which it reflects an undersatnding of the capabilities of the selected technology.
    
    An example of a high-quality design specification will be provided.

    After the specifications are submitted, they will be approved or amended as necessary by the instructor, and the approved or amended specifications will guide the evaluation of the project implementation.

2. Project Implementation (60% of project mark)

    The students will create the actual tool, and publish the source code for that tool to GitHub with a link to a web-accessible demonstration. The tool will be assessed for the degree to which it adheres to best practices discussed in the course, its usability, the degree to which it adheres to the design specifications, correctly implements the capabilities of the technology, and accomplishes the objectives of the project.

3. Project Pitch (20% of project mark)

    The students will be asked to give an interactive demonstration and proposal for the adoption of their tool in the client organization.  This presentation will be no longer than 20 minutes.  The presentation will be assessed for its professionalism, the degree to which it anticipates the needs and concerns of the client organization and ultimate users of the tool, and substantively addresses those needs and concerns.

At the discretion of the instructor, and with the agreement of appropriate representatives of a legal services organization, students may opt to design a tool for a specific non-profit or pro bono legal service organization in the Edmonton region. If they do so, they will be expected to involve that organization in the design of the tool, and will be allowed to have representatives of that organization attend the “pitch”. Students interested in pursuing this option will be required to propose such a project, and obtain the agreement of the organization to participate, by the date of class 6. Note that having an external client of this nature is a pre-requisite of participation in the Iron Tech Lawyer competition (described below).

Pursuing this option will allow students to obtain feedback from potential users to better understand the design process. Students will be provided with resources at the start of the semester to assist in recruiting third-party organizations, but no guarantees can be offered that external clients will be available.

For projects that do not have an external organization involved, the instructor will serve in the role of the client in the design process. While the opportunity will be provided for outside organization to provide feedback on the proposals and attend the students’ “pitch”, feedback from external organizations will not be considered in the students’ evaluation.

## Iron Tech Lawyer Invitational

The Georgetown Law school at Georgetown Tech in Washington DC has hosted, for the last several years, a competition among students who are building access to justice applications using technology or data science. In 2019, the competition was made an invitational for any English-language post-secondary institutions. Students from the Coding the Law course represented the University of Alberta Faculty of Law in the inaugural Spring 2020 edition of the competition.

The Major Project portion of the course is designed to meet the requirements for submission as an entry in the Iron Tech Lawyer Invitational *if students choose to use an external client*. Students who are interested in representing the University of Alberta at this event should advise the instructor as soon as possible. Only one project from any institution can be sent. If there is more than one student group interested in competing, we will make arrangements to have the pitches and the projects judged, and a representative project selected from among them.

Details on the competition are at https://www.georgetowntech.org/irontechlawyer.

Georgetown does not provide funding for travel and accommodations. Funding may be obtained through various University programmes, or arranged privately by the students. Canadian Legal Technology companies have indicated a willingness to participate in funding Coding the Law students to attend the competition in the past.

**NB**: Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2020/2021 Iron Tech Lawyer Invitational will be held as a virtual event.

## Course Schedule
The following schedule is tentative, and subject to change.  The technical learning assignment listed for each class will be discussed during that class and is due by the start of the following class.

### Phase 1 - Docassemble Technical Learning

#### Class 1 - Introduction to the Course, Docassemble Basics, Critical Resources - September 11, 2020

The purpose of this class is to introduce you to the structure and expectations of the course, and provide you with the technical tools and resources you will need to participate in the Technical Learning Assignments. You will learn everything you need to know to complete the first technical learning assignment. You will more than likely complete that assignment during class, and if not will be given the resources to complete it over the course of the week.

Technical Learning:	Assignment 1

#### Class 2 - Docassemble Fundamentals - September 18, 2020

In this class you will be introduced to the method that Docassemble uses for figuring out which question needs to be asked next. You will also be introduced to the tools and techniques that are used to help understand what Docassemble is doing under the hood. You will learn what a "Docassemble Object" is, and how they can be used to simplify the process of building an interview. And you will learn about the different sorts of data that a Docassemble interview is capable of collecting.

Technical Learning:	Assignment 2

#### Class 3 - Automated Document Assembly in Docassemble - September 25, 2020

In this class you will be taught the three fundamental requirements of a document assembly system: variables, conditionals, and loops.
You will be shown how to replace text in a Word document with these three components. You will create a simple template using these
components and create a simple interview that generates a document on the basis of the user's answers and that template.

Technical Learning:	Assignment 3

#### Class 4 - Encoding Legal Rules in Docassemble - October 2, 2020

In this class you will be taught how Docassemble uses "code blocks" to allow you to set out legal logic that can be used to answer questions based on existing knowledge instead of asking for information from the user. You will also get instruction on how to use
code blocks to control the order of questions, and how to modify code blocks and templates so as to exclude questions that are not relevant.

Technical Learning:	Assignment 4  
Major Project: 		Students groups should be determined by the end of this class.

#### Class 5 - Advanced Docassemble Lists - October 9, 2020

In this class you will be shown how you can use Docassemble and Python features in order to collect more complicated information about
individuals or other objects in a list, and how to do calculations about all of the elements in the list at the same time, called aggregate functions. You will also be shown various basic mathematical features of Python to allow you to complete the technical learning assignment, such as value comparisons.

Technical Learning:	Assignment 5

#### Class 6 - Multi-User Interviews in Docassemble - October 16, 2020

In this final class of the first phase, you will be shown how to create a multi-user interview, allowing you to create a workflow
between, for example, a client and a lawyer. You will also learn the security and confidentiality implications of moving away from docassemble's single-user
features to its multi-user features.

Technical Learning:	Assignment 6  
Major Project: 		Proposals for projects involving external clients must be received by the end of this class for approval by the instructor.  
Tech Lawyer Invitational:   Student groups wishing to be considered for participation in the Iron Tech Lawyer Invitational must let
the instructore now by the end of this class.

### Phase 2 - Issues in the Automation of Legal Services

Each class in the second phase of the course will have two topics: a technology topic, and a best practices topic.  The technology
topic will introduce the class to a category of technology for the automation of legal services, and explain how it works, where it
is typically used, and how, and give some basic knowledge for understanding when it is and is not a good solution to a specific
legal automation problem.

The best practices topic will cover a source of concern or opportunity for improvement for the automation of legal services, and will
look at recent legal industry and academic writing on that topic with an eye to understanding how that opportunity or risk might
modify how the students build their major projects.

Assigned readings are with regard to the best practices topics only. Guest speakers may be announced with regard to either category.

Based on factors like student interest, and the major projects selected, this list of topics and assigned readings are subject to change.

#### Class 7  - October 23, 2020

Technical Topic: Automated Document Generation and Client Interview Tools

Docassemble is a client interview and automated document generation tool, but it is not the only one and not yet the most commonly used. Students will be introduced to other tools aimed at the same purposes, including Neota Logic, Contract Express, HotDocs, and many more.

Best Practices Topic: Open-Source and Access to Justice

Required Reading:

* [The Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd)
* [The Montreal Declaration on Open Access to Law](https://www.canlii.org/en/info/mtldeclaration.html)
* [How I Changed the Law with a GitHub Pull Request](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/how-i-changed-the-law-with-a-github-pull-request/)

#### Class 8 - October 30, 2020

Technical Topic: "Rules as Code" and "Smart Contracts": Rules-Based Artificial Intelligence

In this class students will be given an introduction to a new aplication of rules-based artificial intelligence in the public sector
that promises to make laws better written and easier to follow, called "Rules as Code." It will also introduce students to how
rules-based aritificial intelligence is used to generate and deploy "smart contracts", and the relationship between smart contracts and blockchain technology.

Best Practices Topic: Ensuring Quality of Automated Legal Services 

Required Reading:

* [Substantive Legal Software Quality: A Gathering Storm?](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3330000/3326706/p52-lauritsen.pdf?ip=142.244.5.174&id=3326706&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=FD0067F557510FFB%2EE7ED0E691902343F%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1570231240_3dd3c719bf0b938c88c55623a42c8ef7)  

#### Class 9 - November 6, 2020

Technical Topic: eDiscovery

Students will be introduced to the topic of discovery in civil litigation, explain the explosion in cost of discovery that came with
the advent of electronic records and email, and explain how machine learning is used to simplify the task of finding documents
relevant to lawsuits.

Best Practices Topic: Privacy and Automated Legal Services

Major Project: 		Design Specifications due by the end of this class.


#### Class 10 - November 13, 2020

Technical Topic: Natural Language Processing and Generation

In this class the students will be introduced to tools that are designed to automatically read and recognize parts of legal documents such as contracts, to simplify tasks such as due diligence review. Students will also be introduced
to rules-based and data-based methods of generating natural language for legal purposes.

Best Practices Topic: Automated Legal Reasoning and Bias 

Required Reading:

* [Early Predictability of Asylum Court Decisions](https://doi.org/10.1145/3086512.3086537)


#### Class 11 - November 20, 2020

Technical Topic: Online Dispute Resolution

With the covid-19 pandemic, there has been increased focus on the need to operate the justice system without the need for physical
proximity between disputants and the people to whom those disputes are referred. That has rekindled interest in ODR, or online dispute resolution. This class will survey where ODR is being used today, where it is begining to provide services that have never been provided before, and where it is beginning to take over responsibilities that used to belong to courts.

Best Practices Topic: Accessibility, Diversity, and Inclusion in Automated Legal Services

Required Reading:

* [Law Firm Accessibility Standards](https://lawyerist.com/client-service/accessibility-standards/)

#### Class 12 - "Hackathon" - November 27, 2020

This class will be reserved for students to spend time seeking assistance from the instructor in completing their major projects.

#### Class 13 - "Pitches" - December 4, 2020

Project: All major projects must be submitted to the instructor electronically in their final version by the start of this class.

This class will be reserved for students to make their final project presentations.

## Technical Learning Resources

Time will be set aside in each class to address the technical learning assignment set for the week. You are not expected to have read technical resource material in advance.

Extensive documentation on Docassemble is available at https://docassemble.org/docs.
Questions are regularly asked and answered at https://docassemble.slack.com in the #questions channel. Because of the large number of law schools providing training on Docasesmble, there is now a #student-questions channel, that will be populated mostly with law school students and instructors.
Documentation for Python can be found at https://www.python.org/doc/.
And remember, when all else fails... Google is your friend.

## Technical Learning Assignments

You are free to pursue these at your own pace if the schedule is too slow for you. They are scheduled to ensure that you have all the required Docassemble skills in order to complete the major project by the end of the course.

Each week, there will be two exercises. The first is a very small demonstration project 
that implements a new skill or feature in isolation. You are encouraged to do these demonstration projects yourselves as a
learning exercise. But implementing the demonstration project is not mandatory, and they are not graded. All students
will be provided with the source code for the demonstration project, and an explanation of how it works, in class.

The second exercise each week is your "Technical Learning Assignment." This exercise is mandatory, and graded.

The Technical Learning Assignments are cumulative. Over the course of six weeks, you will be improving the same project
by adding features to it that were demonstrated that week. As such, each week's Technical Learning Assignment can only be completed if you have completed the previous weeks' assignments.

**It is therefore very important that you keep up with the Technical Learning Assignments, and seek assistance from the instructor if you are falling behind.**

In the first class, you will be shown how to create and update a GitHub repository with your Docassemble project. You will provide the instructor with the address for the repository and the address for the interview in that first class.

The address for your github repository will be `github.com/[Your GitHub UserName]/docassemble-[your package name]`.

The address for your interview can be found by right-clicking on the "Share" link in the docassemble playground, and copying the link address.

For all subsequent classes, "submitting" your Technical Learning Assignments only requires updating the GitHub repository for your interview.

If the addresses for your GitHub repository and your interview do not change from week to week, there is no need to notify your instructor when you are finished the assignment. Only contact your instructor about completed assignments if there is a change in the access information.

**A very important note about technical learning assignments:**

Docassemble behaves in a way that is sometimes counterintuitive, especially for beginners. The best way to learn it is slowly, one piece at a time. Frequently, it will do "weird" things, like ask questions in an order you weren't expecting. **Do not try to fix weird things your interview is doing unless the assignment specifically requires it.** If you try to fix the weird things before you learn why they are happening, and how to best avoid them, you will clutter your interview with code that will later need to be removed.

You will receive full credit for a technical learning assignment that does what is described in the assignment, even if it does it in a way that is "weird."

Resist the urge to change the order in which interview questions are asked until you are clear on how docassemble calculates it.

### The Target - Legal Aid Eligibility

The final goal of the technical learning assignments is an interview which will
ask the user everthing required to know whether they qualify under Legal Aid Alberta's financial requirements for legal services, to generate an advice memo telling them whether they qualify and why or why not, and to send them a PDF version of that memo by email.

### Demonstration 1

The demonstration for this week will introduce you to:

* GitHub
* The Docassemble Playground
* Slack
* Integrating Docassemble with GitHub
* Question Blocks
* Mandatory Question Blocks
* Inserting Variables in Docassemble Questions

### Assignment 1 - Hello World
* Before starting the technical learning assignment you should have completed the following steps in class:
    * Obtain a GitHub account if you don’t have one
    * Obtain a Docassemble account (details will be provided in class)
    * Join the #student-questions, #questions, and class-specific channels on the Docassemble slack.
    * Say “hello” in the #student-questions channel.
    * Configure your Docassemble account to synchronize with GitHub.
* Create a “Hello World” Interview that asks for the user’s name, and displays it back to them in a friendly greeting.

### Demonstration 2

The demonstration for this week will introduce you to:

* The "Objects" Block
* The "Individual" Object
* The "DAList" Object
* Object Attributes
* Generic Object Questions
* Yes/No Fields
* Mutliple-Choice Fields
* Signature Fields

### Assignment 2 - Docassemble Basics
* Using the "objects" initial block, modify your interview to use an “Individual” object to represent the user, and a DAList to rerpesent a list of other Individuals with whom the user lives.
* Using the “generic object modifier”, create a single question block in your interview file that asks for names of people.
* Add screens to your interview that request information with different interfaces:
    * A Yes/No question using the “yesno” modifier
    * A multiple-choice field that allows the user to select more than one option.
    * A multiple-choice field that allows the user to select only one option.
    * A signature.

### Demonstration 3

The demonstration for this week will introduce you to:

* Docassemble Attachments
* Formatting Lists
* Conditional Formatting
* Formatting Dates
* Document Templates

### Assignment 3 - Document Automation

**NB: From this assignment forward, do not remove anything from prior assignments unless specifically instructed.
Each assignment builds on the last.**

So, for example, this assignment should still use a DAList of Individual objects to collect the list of people with whom the
user lives.

* Add a yes or no question to the interview for whether or not the user qualifies for legal aid (this is temporary for this week)
* Create a document template for an advice memo that includes:
    * the user’s name,
    * the list of people with whom the user lives, displayed in a grammatically correct way (for example, "You live with Jane, Bob, and Sam.")
    * two paragraphs, only one of which is included in any generated document, based on whether or not the person qualifies for legal aid
    * a date value displayed in at least two different date formats
* Modify your interview so the document is generated and provided for download on the last screen of the interview.

### Demonstration 4

The demonstration for this week will introduce you to:

* How Docassemble Decides Which Question To Ask
* Code Blocks
* Conditional Statements in Python
* Using Mandatory Code Blocks To Control When and Whether Questions Are Asked

### Assignment 4 - Encoding Rules

This assignment assumes the following rules for eligibility to Legal Aid Alberta services:

0. Legal aid services are available to people who are unrepresented, resident in Alberta, and who require a provided service.
1. If a person has a lawyer who is still acting for them, or if they can afford a lawyer, they are represented.
2. Legal Aid will provide assistance with either criminal or family law matters located in Alberta only.
3. As an exception, legal aid will provide assistance to a person who is appealing a decision on which they have previously
   gotten help from legal aid, regardless of the location of the person and the matter.

* Modify your interview to request the following yes/no pieces of information:
    * Does the user have a lawyer?
    * Can the user afford a lawyer?
    * If the client has a lawyer, is that lawyer still acting for the user?
    * Is the user’s legal matter located in Alberta?
    * Is the user’s legal matter a family law matter?
    * Is the user’s legal matter a criminal law matter?
    * Does the user live in Alberta?
    * Is the user’s matter an appeal of a matter for which the user received LAA assistance?
* Create 3 or more “code” blocks in your interview which will calculate the value of these yes/no variables (one per block):
    * Does the user meet the requirements of being unrepresented?
    * Does the user meet the residency requirements?
    * Is the user eligible to receive legal aid services?
* Modify your template to inform the user of all the information that they entered, but only if they entered it.
* Modify your template so that the "you qualify" and "you do not qualify" paragraphs appear based on the variable that indicates
  whether the user is eligible to receive legal aid services.
* Remove the question from your interview added in TLA3 that asks whether the user is eligible.
* Remove any questions remaining from TLA2 that are not being used to generate the document or calculate eligibility.
* Modify the interview so that only one question or code block is marked as mandatory.
* Using the code blocks in your interview (not the question blocks), make sure the following questions are not asked in the follow circumstances:
    * If you know the user has received prior assistance, do not ask about the nature of the matter or its location or the
      person's residence.
    * If the person says they can afford a lawyer, don't ask them if they have one still acting for them.
    * If the person does not have a laywer, don't ask whether their lawyer is acting for them.

### Demonstration 5

The demonstration for this week will introduce you to:

* DALists of Objects
* Docassemble Value Objects
* Using DAList Complete Attribute To Collect information about objects in lists

### Assignment 5 - Customized List Collection

For this assignment, rule 0 above is modified as follows:

0. Legal aid services are available to people who are unrepresented, resident in Alberta, and who require a provided service, and who
   are either financially eligible or marginally financially eligible.
   
For this assignment, imagine that the rules of the Law Society of Alberta with regard to financial eligibility are as follows:

A person is financially eligible for legal aid services if their and their family's income in the last 30 days, combined, is at or below the maximum
for a family of that size, and their and their family's income in the last year, combined, is at or below the maximum for a family of that size.  A person is marginally financially eligible if neither value is more than 10% higher than the maximum. A person is financially ineligible if either value is more than 10% higher than the maximum. For the purpose of this rule a person's "family" is
everyone they live with.

Family Size | Maximum Income Last 30 Days | Maximum Income Last Year 
---|---|---
1|$1,668|$20,021
2|$2,066|$24,788
3|$2,940|$35,275
4|$3,178|$38,134
5|$3,416|$40,995
6 or more|$3,655|$43,855

* Modify your interview so that with regard to both the user and all the person with whom the user lives, the interview will ask for
  three additional pieces of information:
    * The person's assets
    * The person's income in the last 30 days
    * The person's income in the last year
* These three pieces of information should be requested on a single screen, separate from the screen that asks for the person's name.
* These three pieces of information should be asked for immediately after the person's name is provided.
* Add a code block to calculate whether the user is "financially eligible", "marginally financially eligible", or "financially ineligible" based on the rules above.
* Modify the existing code blocks to reflect the change to rule 0.
* Modify your template to show the asset and income information collected.
* Modify your template to indicate the user's financial eligibility.

### Demonstration 6

The demonstration for this week will introduce you to:

* Multi-user interviews
* Sending emails from within Docassemble

### Assignment 6 - Multi-user Interviews
* Modify your interview so that immediately before the advice memo is generated, the user is asked to wait for approval while the advice memo is confirmed.
* Have the interview generate the document, and send an email to a second user.
* The email to the second user should include a link to go to the interview.
* When the second user gets to the interview, they should be presented with a screen in which they can view the document and indicate whether or not they approve of the memo.
* Once the second user has indicated if they approve the memo or not, the original user should receive an email with a link saying that the response has been received, and providing a link to go back to the interview.
* When the first user returns to the interview, they should either see a message saying that approval was refused, or be able to download the memo as usual.
* When this is working, set the second user’s email address to the instructor's email address, and have the email’s subject line begin with “LAW589 Assignment 6”.

Policy about course outlines can be found in §23.4(2) of the University Calendar.

## Academic Integrity
The University of Alberta is committed
to the highest standards of academic integrity and honesty. Students are expected to be familiar
with these standards regarding academic honesty and to uphold the policies of the University in this
respect. Students are particularly urged to familiarize themselves with the provisions of the Code of
Student Behaviour (online at www.governance.ualberta.ca) and avoid any behaviour which could
potentially result in suspicions of cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation of facts and/or
participation in an offence. Academic dishonesty is a serious offence and can result in suspension or
expulsion from the University.

## Audio-Visual Recording
Audio or video recording of lectures,
labs, seminars or any other teaching environment by students is allowed only with the prior
written consent of the instructor or as a part of an approved accommodation plan. Recorded
material is to be used solely for personal study, and is not to be used or distributed for any other
purpose without prior written consent from the instructor.
