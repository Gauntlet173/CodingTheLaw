  # This is a block that is used to "complete" elements in the jedi list.
  # The complete_attribute value which can be set on the DAList object tells
  # docassemble which single object property must have a value before the
  # object in the list is considered complete. You can then use a code
  # block that searches for generic jedi list objects' complete attribute
  # and use that code block to name the things that need to be collected and
  # the order.
  
  jedi[i].name.first
  
  # Note that you can remove the above line, because the name is used in the
  # question for sith_tendencies. If it was not, and you left out the above
  # line, the name of the jedi would not be collected until it was needed,
  # which is when generating the last screen.
  
  jedi[i].sith_tendencies
  # Note that when sith_tendencies is asked for, lightsaber colour is asked, too.
  # You only need to include one element per screen to force a screen to appear.
  
  jedi[i].complete = True
  
  # Now an object in the list will not be considered completely collected until
  # this code block is run. And this code block forces Docassemble to ask for
  # other pieces of information before it can set the item as complete.
